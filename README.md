BookBuilder
===========

This application aims to solve the problem described here:
http://codekata.com/kata/kata14-tom-swift-under-the-milkwood/

The problem is initially splitted into two and thus solved as two diferent solutions tied together sequentially.

The first problem
=================
The first problem forces the application to read through a large amount of text data in order to build a map as shown by the description of the main problem.
I aim to obtain a list of trigrams used by the books sampled and merge them into a consistent data structure.

The second problem
==================
